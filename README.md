# Using Local History
[Local history](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/local-history.html) keeps track of changes made to the source code Â 
and directory structure of your project. Using Local history enables you to view the past changes, restore or delete them, 
roll back to a previous state of any file, folder, and even restore deleted files.

Local history is designed for a short-term usage. If you need to keep track of changes over longer time periods, use an external VCS. 
Note also that Local history gets cleared when you install a new version of IntelliJ IDEA or when you [invalidate cashes](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/cleaning-system-cache.html).
Therefore, it is a good idea to check in the changes to VCS before performing these operations.

This section describes how to:

* [View local history of a file or folder](viewing-local-history-of-a-file.md)
* [View local history of a class, method, field, or code selection](viewing-local-history-of-a-source-code.md)
* [Restore a deleted file](restoring-a-deleted-file)
* [Revert to a previous version](reverting_to_a_previous-version.md)
* [Put a label to a project](putting-labels.md)
* [Create a patch](creating-patch.md)
