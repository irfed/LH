## <a name="why_use"></a>Why Use Labels
Labels apply to a whole project and mark its specific version. They are noticeably displayed in the Local history dialog. Whenever you reach a significant milestone or simply 
have a stable version, put a meaningful label. Later on, you can quickly roll back to a labeled version 
or [create a patch](creating-a-patch.md) from it.

## <a name="add_label"></a>Adding a Label 
To add a label to the local copy of your project,
1. Select a file or folder in the Project tool window or open a file in the editor.
1. Do one of the following:
    * On the main **VCS** menu or from the context menu of the selection, choose **Local History | Put Label**.
    * Press Alt+Back Quote (Ctrl+V on OSX) and choose **Put Label** from the VCS Operations Pop-up list.
1. In the Put Label dialog box, type label name.
